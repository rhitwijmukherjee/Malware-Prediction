# Malware-Prediction
## ***Procedure and Observations:***
- Feature 1: byte unigram + byte size + asm unigram + asm size features (result_x). Already given in the notebook i just added an id colm which is equal to result.csv id. total 308 colms
- Feature 2: byte bigram features (by_bigram_df) used random forest feature selection based on Apriori Algorithm took top 300 bigrams.
- Feature 3: opcodes bigram features (op_bigram_df) extracted from asm files used random forest feature selection based on Apriori Algorithm took top 200 bigrams.
- Feature 4: opcodes trigram features (op_trigram_df) extracted from asm files used random forest feature selection based on Apriori Algorithm took top 200 trigrams.
- Feature 5: image pixels features (Image_df) used first 500 pixels extracted from asm files.
- Got log loss 0.01 after adding opcode trigram feature misclassified points 0.13799448022079117
